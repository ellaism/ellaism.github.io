## Hard Fork

Ellaism Core proposed and planned a hard fork at block number 2,000,000, happening around end of August, 2018. This hard fork adds Ethereum Byzantium features and enables WebAssembly scripting on Ellaism blockchain. You can find more information below:

* [Byzantium Hardfork Meta](https://github.com/ellaism/specs/blob/master/specs/2018-0004-byzantium.md) ([Discussions](https://github.com/ellaism/specs/issues/12))
* [WebAssembly Hardfork Meta](https://github.com/ellaism/specs/blob/master/specs/2018-0003-wasm-hardfork.md) ([Discussions](https://github.com/ellaism/specs/issues/11))

## Development

* We release two new versions of multi-geth. However, multi-geth is being discontinued because of the WebAssembly upgrade. ETH/ETC support will be maintained by [Ethoxy Initiative](https://github.com/ethoxy/multi-geth). We urge existing multi-geth users to migrate to [Parity](https://github.com/paritytech/parity).
* Shikinseki testnet is upgraded with support of Byzantium features and WebAssembly, in preparation of the upcoming hard fork.
* Our [wiki page](https://github.com/ellaism/meta/wiki) can now be accessed from [wiki.ellaism.org](https://wiki.ellaism.org), thanks to work done by @stevemulligan.
* A new bot, called "EllaBot", is developed by @kubu00. You can interact it in our [Discord server](https://discord.ellaism.org).
* Development of an Ellaism-branded dapps browser is started.
* Various bug fixes and improvements to [open-ethereum-pool](https://github.com/ellaism/open-ethereum-pool).
